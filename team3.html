<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>An ethical issue in nanomedicine is protecting participants private information where medical records of body organs are stored electronically which stores results. It is evidential that clinicians consult with their patients remotely to discuss their test results or recently diagnosed condition which is then recorded in the system.
